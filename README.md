# HieroWise - Hieroglyph Detection System 🏺🔍

HieroWise is a web application designed for anyone interested in the meanings of hieroglyphic symbols, whether visiting Egypt or exploring ancient writing. This user-friendly platform allows users to upload images of hieroglyphs, which are analyzed by an AI model to detect and predict the symbols. The detections are based on the Gardiner signs, a system developed by Sir Alan Gardiner that classifies hieroglyphic symbols into distinct categories.

Upon uploading an image, users receive an output that includes:
- 🖼️ An image with the detected glyphs highlighted.
- 📋 A table containing each detected glyph with its number, a detailed description, and its historical context.

This provides users with a comprehensive understanding of the hieroglyphs they are exploring. Additionally, users can download the resulting images that contain the predicted glyphs, allowing them to keep a visual record of their discoveries.

For administrators, HieroWise includes an **admin login** feature. Administrators can log in to view a table listing users' IP addresses, the images they uploaded, and the images generated by the application. This functionality helps manage and monitor app usage, ensuring smooth operation. Admins can securely log out after completing their tasks, maintaining the system's integrity. 🔒👨‍💻
